# SolMerchant

SolMerchant is a fast and easy to use Point of Sale system built on the Solana blockchain. This dapp simply allows a seller to connect their wallet
to the site and generate a SolanaPay QR code of any amount that will enable anyone to transfer funds to the sellers connected wallet. The dapp has a confirmation check that lets the seller know when if the transaction was successful and then allows them to mint a receipt as an NFT with the CrossMint NFT API.
